Following TDD, I implemented the basic credit card processing program in Python,mainly because Python get a easy-to-use unittest tool. 

According to the input assumption, all functions required have been implemented.I already sensed some of refactoring needed in this code and more patterns should have been used....

For testing, please execute the test_CCProcessing.py testcase under test/

 
Thanks.
