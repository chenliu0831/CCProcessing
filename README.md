CCProcessing
============
Following TDD, I implemented the basic credit card processing program in Python,mainly because Python get a easy-to-use unittest tool. 

I already sensed some of refactoring needed in this code and more patterns should have been used....

For testing, please execute the test_CCProcessing.py testcase under test/
